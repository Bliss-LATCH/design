# LATCH Project Overview

**LATCH (Lightweight Actuated Tunnel for Crewed Habitats)** is a modular, lightweight, actuated tunnel system designed to enable safe and efficient crewed transportation between surface habitats on lunar and Martian environments. The system focuses on deployability, reliability, and adaptability to harsh extraterrestrial conditions while minimizing mass and operational complexity.

The requirements, constraints, and evaluation criteria for this project are defined in the NASA-provided solicitation, which can be found here:

## Project Background

The **BLISS (Bliss) Lab** at the **University of Michigan** has developed an innovative solution to address NASA’s challenge. This solution integrates mechanical design, embedded systems, control software, and systems engineering into a unified architecture capable of supporting crewed surface operations.

This organization contains the full set of repositories used to design, prototype, simulate, and validate the LATCH system. These repositories collectively support the development lifecycle from early concept exploration through system integration and testing.

## The Design Repository

This repository serves as the primary reference for the **LATCH system architecture and design documentation**. It is intended to provide a clear and comprehensive overview of both the software and hardware components that make up the system.

Specifically, this repository includes:
- High-level system architecture and design rationale
- Detailed documentation of major software components
- Descriptions of hardware interfaces and control electronics
- Explanations of key subsystems, including actuation, sensing, communication, and power management
- Design trade studies, assumptions, and constraints
- Diagrams and figures illustrating system behavior and data flow

The goal of this repository is to enable:
- Clear understanding of how the system operates as a whole
- Easy onboarding for new contributors
- Traceability between requirements, design decisions, and implementation
- Long-term maintainability and extensibility of the codebase

All documentation is written in **Markdown** to ensure readability, version control compatibility, and ease of collaboration.
